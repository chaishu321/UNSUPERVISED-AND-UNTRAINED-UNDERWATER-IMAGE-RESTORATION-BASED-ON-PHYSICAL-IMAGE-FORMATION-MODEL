# UNSUPERVISED AND UNTRAINED UNDERWATER IMAGE RESTORATION BASED ON PHYSICAL IMAGE FORMATION MODEL
We propose an unsupervised and untrained underwater image restoration method based on the layer disentanglement and the underwater image formation model.




## Dependencies

* Python == 3.6.10
* Pytorch == 1.1.0 
* opencv-python == 3.4.2.16 
* opencv-contrib-python == 3.4.2.16 

We also export our conda virtual environment as UIE.yaml. You can use the following command to create the environment.

```bash
conda env create -f UIE.yaml
```

## Demo

You can use the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```
